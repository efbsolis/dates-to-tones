This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.1.

## Browser Support
Currently, the known web browsers that support this web app are:
* Desktop versions of Chrome.
* Android-based versions of Firefox.

## Known issues
* Desktop Firefox (and possibly Webkit-based browsers) do not handle calendar input tags properly, as detailed here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22983013/how-to-get-html-5-input-type-date-working-in-firefox-and-or-ie-10.
* iOS-based Safari & Chrome do not get past the loading screen (maybe Gecko-based browsers in general).

## Generating, running and testing
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
